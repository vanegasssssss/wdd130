          <h2>ems and rems</h2>
            <p>
              em and rem are the two relative lengths you are likely to encounter most frequently when sizing anything from boxes to text. It's worth understanding how these work, and the differences between them, especially when you start getting on to more complex subjects like styling text or CSS layout. The below example provides a demonstration.
              
              The HTML illustrated below is a set of nested lists — we have two lists in total and both examples have the same HTML. The only difference is that the first has a class of ems and the second a class of rems.
              
              To start with, we set 16px as the font size on the html element.
              
              To recap, the em unit means "my parent element's font-size" in the case of typography. The li elements inside the ul with a class of ems take their sizing from their parent. So each successive level of nesting gets progressively larger, as each has its font size set to 1.3em — 1.3 times its parent's font size.
              
              To recap, the rem unit means "The root element's font-size" (rem stands for "root em"). The li elements inside the ul with a class of rems take their sizing from the root element html. This means that each successive level of nesting does not keep getting larger.
              
              However, if you change the html element's font-size in the CSS you will see that everything else changes relative to it — both rem- and em-sized text.</p>
              
              <!-- For the next example check the css code and look for the classes "ems" and "rems" -->
              
              <ul class="ems">
                <li>One</li>
                <li>Two</li>
                <li>Three
                  <ul>
                    <li>Three A</li>
                    <li>Three B
                      <ul>
                        <li>Three B 2</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <ul class="rems">
                <li>One</li>
                <li>Two</li>
                <li>Three
                  <ul>
                    <li>Three A</li>
                    <li>Three B
                      <ul>
                        <li>Three B 2</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
        
              <h2>Line height units</h2>
                <p>lh and rlh are relative lengths units similar to em and rem. The difference between lh and rlh is that the first one is relative to the line height of the element itself, while the second one is relative to the line height of the root element, usually <html>.

                  Using these units, we can precisely align box decoration to the text. In this example, we use lh unit to create notepad-like lines using repeating-linear-gradient(). It doesn't matter what's the line height of the text, the lines will always start in the right place.</p>
        
                  <p class="lh" style="line-height: 2em">
                    Summer is a time for adventure, and this year was no exception. I had many
                    exciting experiences, but two of my favorites were my trip to the beach and my
                    week at summer camp.

                  <p class="lh" style="line-height: 4em">
                    At the beach, I spent my days swimming, collecting shells, and building
                    sandcastles. I also went on a boat ride and saw dolphins swimming alongside
                    us.

              <h2>Length & Percentages</h2>
                  <p>Note that, while many value types accept a length or a percentage, there are some that only accept length. You can see which values are accepted on the MDN property reference pages. If the allowed value includes length-percentage then you can use a length or a percentage. If the allowed value only includes length, it is not possible to use a percentage.</p>
